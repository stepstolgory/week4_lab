# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975", "1989", "1993", "1995", "1999", "2001", "2003", "2005", "2007", "2009", "2011"),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here
 ggplot(data = staff_long,
        mapping = aes(x = year, 
                      y = percent, 
                      colour = faculty_type)) +
     geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here

 ggplot(data = staff_long,
        mapping = aes(x = year, 
                      y = percent, 
                      colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))

ggplot(data = staff_long,
        mapping = aes(x = year, 
                      y = percent, 
                      colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
